"Minor's house is quite large and comfortable.  There are restaurants and supermarket nearby for shopping and eating out.  Our family of four has enough room to spread out.  The big plus is there is parking for our car, a rare find in the city of Boston.  Minor was very responsive with any question that I have and tried to check up on us during our stay to make sure everything is ok.  "
The house was well situated and perfect for our family. Minor was very very nice and we enjoyed our stay very  much.
"Minor was very good at getting back to me about our booking and asking if there was anything else we needed to make our stay more comfortable. The house has loads of space, a big kitchen to cook in (which we did with joy) and a lovely deck with a beautiful garden. Upstairs in the master bedroom tea and coffee making facilities were provided which was a nice touch as the bedroom is on the 3rd level so we could easily make a tea without needing to go downstairs. Most importantly the master bed was soooo comfortable!

This area of Jamaica Plain is a cultural melting pot that has a good vibe, I can tell it's slowly becoming a trendier spot than what it use to be.

All in all a good stay."
"Our family (2 adults, 2 kids and a dog) stayed here for a wedding in Boston. Minor checked in with us before we arrived and reminded us how to get into the house. It was a great location for us and a very nice home. It was the first time we had stayed in an Airbnb that is otherwise lived in by the host family, so that took a little getting used to, but it is a nice place with a very pleasant back deck and sleeping areas. I wouldn't recommend for small children because of the steep stairs, but great for families with older kids. It was especially nice to have a dog-friendly spot!"
Minor's place was great! Accurately described- great for a family.
"Minor provided us with all the necessary information about the house, the neighborhood and the city. He left breakfast for us  in the fridge and really let to our disposal his home, which is very cozy. He is also very accessible and the communication is easy and immediate."
"Minor's home was great! It is very spacious and very quiet. He was easy to communicate with, left great instructions and and we had provided some breakfast items including coffee. It is a short walk to the metro and not long at all to arrive to downtown Boston. We were very happy with our stay, thank you!"
"We were made to feel very welcome in this lovely family home so full of character in Jamaica Plain in Boston.  The host seemed to think of everything we might need (including the wifi code!), supplied us with excellent information about the house, the neighbourhood and suggestions of things to do in Boston, and checked in with us a number of times to make sure we were OK.  The neighbours were friendly and helpful. The house is very close to the subway - so quick access into Boston centre, and there are shops and restaurants close by. An excellent choice by us for our short stay in Boston and we would highly recommend it to other airbnb-ers."
"Minor is a wonderful host who does his best to make your staying easy and pleasent. The house is nice, quite big, really confortable and fully equipped. Lovely neighborhood and very good restaurants around (I strongly suggest the cuban !!). I really liked it and would consider to get back there, one day"
"We had a great experience at this BnB. Family members flew in from all over to celebrate my daughter's school ceremony in Boston. The downstairs neighbor greeted us and even helped with luggage. Lillie stayed in touch via email to make sure we had everything we needed. There were two air conditioning units on third floor, and we kept the second floor cooled with fans. It worked out well. The kitchen was quite big and we were able to cook dinners and meals. Overall good experience. "
"We really enjoyed our stay! Coffee, fresh orange juice and fruits were waiting for us in the kitchen."
"My family and I stayed at this lovely home for one night.  The home is spacious, comfortable and approximately 6 miles from downtown Boston. The beds were comfortable, bathrooms updated-and the baby with us also enjoyed a comfortable crib.  The hosting family made everything very inviting.  I strongly recommend staying here next time you are coming to Boston.  "
"This house is beautiful, comfortable and extremely unique.  It is an amazing location in a wonderful neighborhood.  I cannot begin to say how much it has meant for my family to stay here--we live in the neighborhood and had water damage to our home--and being here has been the silver lining to a very difficult time for us.  Sybil took care of us at every step--making sure we had everything we needed.  She was also very flexible about our needs.  In the words of my kids, ""I never want leave here."""
Sybil was very accommodating and easy to communicate with.  The house is beautiful and comfortable.  It's a special place to stay and it's location is great--it's so very central to all of the awesomeness of JP.
Un séjour agréable dans une maison bien équipée
"Located in nice area near Boston apartment is rather big
It takes 10-15 min to get to the downtown of Boston
Good for big groups or families, parking is free at the street
Please, note that  has no airconditioning and need some refurbishing "
Marian was very accommodating and easy to get in touch with
"Marian's apartment is large and is located in a nice neighbourhood close to public transport, restaurants etc. We felt really good here."
Merveilleuse maison dans un quartier calme. A proximité d'un 7Eleven et d'un supermarché bio et de restaurants. La maison est très agréable et confortable avec un équipement complet. Un havre de paix et de calme après le Freedom Trail. Nous n'avons pas rencontré Marian mais les communications par SMS étaient super. Nous avions une voiture de location donc nous n'avons pas pu tester la proximité du métro et des bus mais sur le plan ça ne semble pas loin.
Cute Victorian home in good location.  Description of house and amenities were accurate.  Marian was great and kept in contact.
"Jamaica Plain is an amazing little neighborhood and Marian's place is a beautiful home. I feel fortunate to have been able to stay there for a convention event with 7 others. Everything is fully stocked, it is as if staying in your own home. For example, we needed bandaids and they were readily available! Marian was very kind from the interactions we had and the Airbnb also had a binder which had everything in it from local events, resturants, and anything we could need to know about the house. Amazing stay, highly recommend. "
"The condo was very well positioned in a GREAT location! The condo has 3 very good size bedrooms and a 4th sofa bed pull out, the only thing to be conscious of is there is only one bathroom - but that is made clear on the description. The condo has a very nice homely feel to it and Marian very kindly leaves a lot of the generic amenities (like toilet paper, dishwasher tablets, salt, pepper, etc.) out for your use. The garden is fantastic and the kids loved playing basketball and climbing on the climbing frame. 

Jamaica Plain is a great neighborhood, there is a fantastic park and lake at the end of the road and in general there is a great choice of restaurants.

It is a very clean condo and we would definitely come back and stay again if we were to visit Boston again."
"The listing accurately reflects the place.  The neighborhood is great.  We loved being able to walk to Whole Foods and other restaurants.  We wish we had more time to explore the area!
The house is older and this unit is on the first floor.  You do hear some footsteps from upstairs (during normal waking hours - nothing to disrupt sleep), but otherwise the unit is quiet.  It was clean, comfortable, and well equipped.  "
The experience was pleasant as the host is very responsive and the house was beautiful. The large binder near the entrance was especially helpful as the list of must-go places and nearby restaurants with maps and addresses make our stay there pleasant and convenient.
We really enjoyed our time at Marian's apartment. It is very spacious and very well equipped with kitchen supplies and linens. Being able to enjoy the backyard space was also wonderful. We would definitely stay here again.
"This apartment was perfect for our 4 day family gathering to attend my son's graduation from Boston University.  The place was clean, well stocked and completely charming.  The beds and all the rooms comfortable.  Off street parking was easy (unusual for Boston) and we loved the neighborhood.  You could walk to the local restaurants as well as Jamaica Pond and park.  We didn't take advantage of public transportation to get downtown but it was about a 15 minute drive, a $7 Uber fare.  I would stay here again without hesitation.  Thank you Marian!
"
"Amazing stay! Very well equipped apartment, completely unpretentions, filled with lovely antique accents. Sweet neighborhood."
"Marian was an awesome host and very accommodating. The house is exactly as advertised, very clean.  The location is great, quick access to public transportation and close to the downtown core. Also, very close to several restaurant/bars and shopping centres.  "
"Marian was a wonderful host.  Everything was in place as advertised, and the house was very clean and comfortable.  The pantry even had a few spices we did not expect.  We did see her once, and she was very gracious.  The location was also great for public transportation; one block to the bus stop and 0.5 miles to the Orange Line.  The Green Line was also only 0.8 miles away, but we never walked to its station.  Whole Foods was also only 2 blocks away."
Marian made us feel extremely welcome. She was extremely kind and accommodating during a difficult time (family member in hospital).
"Marian's house is really lovely inside. It is warm and inviting, comfortable and well-appointed.  We hosted a family gathering and had room for all of the extended family and friends to enjoy a nice meal. The location is excellent! There is ample parking, it is easy to find, and amenities are close at hand. "
"The apartment was exactly as described and very cosy for my family's 5 day stay in Boston. Parking on the street was easy and great restaurants, grocery and some shopping was right down the street. Thanks for a great stay Marian!"
"Wonderful stay at Marian's apartment. Fully equipped kitchen was much appreciated and cosy sitting room was very nice for a relaxing chat in the evening. Great location for the Pond, close to Whole Foods, and all the amenities of Centre St. "
"Pasamos unos días muy lindos en casa de Marian. 
Eramos 7 (dos parejas, dos adolescentes y un bebé) y todos estabamos bien comodos.
El barrio es muy lindo. "
It was a great stay for our team. Perfect space. Nice and clean. Lovely neighborhood!!
"Wonderful apartment in really nice neighborhood. Marian has described everything accordingly on airbnb and provides plenty more info in a folder that you'll find in the living room. The apt was equipped with everything one needed and was very clean and neat! We were 8 and had a wonderful time. There is a Whole Foods market(plus 7eleven and cvs pharmacy) just around the corner which is a big plus as well and it took us usually around 15-20 minutes into the city including a nice little walk down Moraine street to Stony Brook Station which is the closest T station.

Would absolutely recommend staying there, thank you Marian!"
"Hostess was a great communicator before and during our stay.  The house was beautifully furnished, comfortable, and had a super convenient location.  Plenty of parking available on the street at all times of the day.  Would highly recommend this rental."
"Marian was a great host. The listing was accurate and the location was perfect for us. Close to dining, Whole Foods, and the T. "
"Everything was as it was described on the site, very comfy rooms, lots of utilities for everything. It was easy to get quick assistance when needed. The only downside was having only one bathroom for 6 people, that was a bit stressful in the morning. The neighborhood was quaint with everything we needed, and a very quick & convenient ride to Boston."
Good apartment in a wonderful area. Marian was responsive to our needs.
"The information from Marian about the ""beautiful 3 BR with great location"" was very accurate.  We loved the house and the area of Jamaica Plain was very nice and very easy to get around.  Also good service on the T or the bus to downtown Boston.  
Marian was attentive and quite flexible in her approach!"
"My organization used the house for a 5-day staff retreat, with 5 people sleeping there and 10 for meetings during the day.  The space was clean, well-stocked, and organized sensibly.  It had  a nice variety of spices and cooking equipment.  The location was very convenient, and Marian was responsive to all our needs. "
This is a lovely home. It was very well described in the posting. We very much enjoyed our visit. It was very convenient to the bus line for getting around without a car. Parking on the street was very easy.
"We had a wonderful 3 week stay in Marian's apartment, which is spacious and had everything we needed. The location couldn't be better, with local transport close by to take you into Boston. It is free to park on the street, where we had no problems parking our car.
 Our 2 year old loved the pond and play parks, which are only a short walk away. Jamaica Pond is a pleasant neighbourhood, with good places to eat and shop. 
Marian was helpful and was happy to offer recommendations. 
If visiting Boston again we would stay here again."
"Wir hatten 3 schöne Tage in Boston und haben uns zu acht sehr wohl in der wundervollen Wohnung gefühlt. Mit der nahe gelegenen Subway gelangt man schnell und preiswert ins Centrum.
Wir kommen gerne wieder in Marians Haus.
Vielen Dank "
"The apartment is beautiful, and Marian was very nice and accommodating. The neighborhood is terrific. Great experience all around."
"Marian was helpful and an amazing host. We travelled to Boston with my wife, 20 month old son and mother in-law. The flat was perfect. Loved the neighborhood. The apartment was Spacious, comfortable and well equipped. It even had a crib and toys our son could play with. We would definitely stay there again. "
"We've loved the apartment and the neighborhood.  The apartment is very spacious and comfortable.  Marian was very helpful, always responded promptly to all questions with detailed answers.  Thank you for your hospitality."
"This is a spacious home in a wonderful neighborhood: there's a Whole Foods close by, good restaurants, and a lovely pond to visit.  It's a short walk to the Orange Line.  Marian is a great host."
"The house is situated in a lovely, tree-lined pedestrian area - lots of joggers and children, etc.  It is a very charming  apartment and is more spacious than photos show. Furnishings are attractive and comfortable. It's location really is great with the easy access to Boston.   I wouldn't hesitate to recommend  this dwelling to anyone."
"Marian's place was a perfect fit for my family which included 2 children, my wife, and in-laws. There were a few toys for the kids as well as a lovely backyard with play structure that kept the kids entertained. The neighborhood was safe and very convenient with everything we needed in close walking distance. We had two cars to park which can be very expensive in Boston, so having free on street parking with close public transit (2 minute walk to bus stop) was great. My wife has to have her run first thing in the morning so the close proximity to Jamaica Pond park was a blessing. I can't say enough about this place. "
We were married at Jamaica Pond Bandstand near Marian's Air BnB. The house was used for a party & reception venue and for lodging for my siblings. We had a delightful stay and celebration. The weather was perfect. We used the back yard with tables. We paid an extra fee for having our friends celebrate our small group of friends(mostly relatives) celebrate with us and an additional fee for the use of the driveway for parking during the period of the wedding and reception. (We chose the period of the weekly street cleaning parking ban for our wedding so parking was an issue).
Marian was a great host.  This was our first AirBnB experience and the first time traveling with a group (College graduation).  Marian's house was exactly as advertised and the location is FANTASTIC!  We enjoyed wonderful morning walks around the Pond and loved the easy access to the train/downtown Boston.  Marian was responsive to our communications.  Would stay again.
"Marian's residence was ideal for my 8 guests from Latin America.  The location in trendy Jamaica Plain is ideal for anyone visiting Boston, with easy access to public transportation.  A beautifully maintained property in a lovely neighborhood.  Marian is a wonderful host who provides all the information and support that one could ask.  Would definitely try to rent this property again if the need arises."
Marian was a great host - excellent communication and very helpful in sorting out things that arose during the stay.
"Marian's house was perfect. I wish I could say I had more time to spend in the neighborhood, too - beautiful houses, great food options, Sam Adams down the road!

Nice to come back to each night instead of a hotel. Everything you'd need in a kitchen, clean, big bedrooms...we appreciate the accommodations!"
"This was my first experience renting a home as opposed to a hotel. I was so nervous but that quickly left when I arrived at Marian's home. It was SO comfortable, so spacious, clean, well equipped kitchen had everything you needed. You could tell there was a lot of thought that went into providing comfort for her guests. The location is great as well. walking distance to whole foods, restaurants etc. We will be staying here again the next time I am visiting my grandchildren. "
"This apartment was recommended to us by friends who actually live in Jamaica Plain. We stayed here with our son (19) and three daughters (10,14,16). Great location and wonderful house. Beds are really comfortable which was a huge bonus! Cute neighborhood with grocery, restaurants, liquor store all within walking distance. Parking was not a problem either. The kitchen is wonderful and always makes it convenient when traveling. Also, very nice to have laundry available. There is not a microwave in the apartment which isn't that big a deal - reheated coffee on the stove top. I did ask Marian about a hair dryer which would have been handy since it was so incredibly cold during our stay. I've always had one when we've stayed in rentals. She indicated she would get one for the apartment. Highly recommend this rental and would definitely stay here again. Thank you for the nice accommodations Marian! 
"
"We had an excellent stay at Marian's place- so much space for us and for our children. I also appreciated how clean the apartment was since we have a crawling baby. My older 2 children loved playing on the swing set in the back yard and we could easily watch them out the kitchen window. The pantry was stocked with all of the odds and ends one might need. Note that there is not a microwave, but it is easy to get by with the oven and stove. Whole Foods is an easy few minutes walk from the place, as is Centre Street, which has all of the best shops and restaurants in JP. We recommend City Feed for sandwiches and light groceries...the Tofurkey sandwich is amazing! Thanks, Marian, for such a great experience. "
"We really enjoyed our stay at Marian's home. The house is spacious, clean, and had everything we needed. It's in a great location. Near the house has a great supermarket - Whole Foods, pharmacy - Wallgreens , restaurants, everything we need, in addition to a lovely park nearby.  
Marian was a great host. She communicated what we needed to know about her home before our stay. We will be sure to stay at Marian's home again, upon future visits to Boston. We really loved our stay!!!"
Beautiful Area and Wonderful Home! I went to Boston for a wedding and I couldn't have picked a better place to stay. It instantly felt like home to me and my family! We had a great experience and would definitely stay here again.
"Had a good stay in Marian's nice 3-bedroom home. The house is well located, spacious and comfortable. During our stay, there were a few things not working, but Marian attended to them quickly to ensure we were comfortable. Would definitely recommend Marian's for a large group."
"We really enjoyed our stay at Marian's home. There were six of us, and had plenty of room. The house is spacious, clean, and had everything we needed. It's in a great location - there are a lot of great restaurants within walking distance, and public transit is only a short walk away.  We all loved our stay. 
Marian was a great host. She communicated what we needed to know about her home before our stay, and provided a guide with information about the house, neighbourhood, and the rest of Boston which we used while we were there. We will be sure to stay at Marian's home again, upon future visits to Boston. "
Marian was a great host. Her house is superb and the neighborhood is nice and quiet. She was very patient and helpful with all of us. We couldn't have found a better place to stay. I highly recommend staying at her house!
"Miriam's house was exactly as described. It was beautiful and clean, and felt like a home away from home. My family and I enjoyed it very much. 

Miriam is super organized with a nice welcome book with instructions, local restaurant info, how to contact her and more. She requests that at the end of your stay, you pull off the bed sheets and leave them in the laundry area, so what was expected of us was very clear. 

Sheets were clean, bedrooms beautifully decorated, and the all of the toiletries one could require, as well as towels were available. 

Her home is close in a nice quiet, yet bustling area with local foot traffic, shops and places to eat. If I could buy Miriam's house I would LOL :)
That's how comfortable we felt there. 

She was there for us if we needed her, but unintrusively kept her distance (not necessary), but she's respectful, and I liked that.

All in all, you can't go wrong with Miriam and her beautiful home. A FANTASTIC first Air BnB experience. 

Thanks Miriam!!

"This is a lovely, large apartment in a great area - close to public transport, shops and cafes. Marian is a gracious and helpful host willingly offering assistance and advice. We had six people staying and there was plenty of room. The kitchen, dining and living area all offer seating and are well equipped."
"We are a family of five and really enjoyed our time in Marian's home. The property was roomy but felt like home. The kitchen was well stocked with cookware, the dishwasher made cleanup easier and the laundry facilities in the house were convenient. There were many thoughtful touches available like family board games, a notebook with helpful information re nearby restaurants and grocery stores, and a laundry hamper to make things feel more like home. We also enjoyed walking around in the neighborhood, in particular the park down the street which had walking/jogging trails which were well maintained. Markets were within easy walking and driving distance. Marian was very accomodating and easy to reach. We would be happy to return during any future stays in Boston."
"Marian’s home was just as described in the profile:  spacious, well-appointed, great neighborhood, easy parking and convenient to public transportation.  The information notebook she provided was helpful; it describes the house, neighborhood, transportation, restaurants and sites to visit.  Marian is a great communicator; we knew just what to expect and what to do upon arrival.  During our stay she brought us an iron and ironing board upon request, which we needed to prepare for a business engagement, and helped us find local tennis courts.  We highly recommend this rental."
"Marian was an excelent host and her apartment is very well located. You can go to the Orange or Green Subway line in less than 10 minutes by walk, so you can go to almost everywhere in Boston and Cambridge. Also the bus stop is just a few steps from the house, and it goes to Copley in minutes. We bought a 7 days Charlie ticket, so transportation was not a problem.
When we arrived the apartment was clean and organized. We were 6, and we have more than enough space with the 3 bedrooms. The apartment kitchen and pantry is big, so you can go to the market and eat at home. It also have a dinning and living room, so you wont have problems with the space.
Marian was very kind and helpful, and we were always in contact before arriving.
If you, or your family are going to Boston, Marian's place is the perfect place to stay.
"
"I live in this same neighborhood but had family coming for Graduation and needed more space. Marian's home was perfect, well located, clean, and parking is easy to find on the street. 3 family members stayed here, and they were quite content. The home was spacious, modern, and well appointed, with dishwasher, laundry, WiFi, and coffee maker. There is heat, but no air conditioning, we had two evenings of 95˚ weather and Marian did bring down 2 fans that we used. The only two things missing are a microwave and a TV (there is a very tiny flatscreen). But really, you probably did not come to Boston to watch the TV. Marian was very easy to contact and lives in the unit above the rental. The house is in a great part of town, very safe, gay-friendly, lots of good restaurants nearby, a Whole Foods about 2-blocks away, and great access to public transport (also easy to get to/from airport).  We even hosted a small gathering at the house (11 persons) post-graduation and had ample space, a good size fridge for stocking with food and beverages, and the house had plenty of kitchenware/glassware so that we did not need anything. There is a comfortable outdoor area that you also have access to that has two outdoor tables that seat about 8, so you could easily grill at night. All in all, we had a great 4-night stay and were well looked after. I would highly recommend this property to anyone coming to Boston. It is a great place, three full bedrooms, lots of space and all at a very reasonable price. Thanks Marian!"
"Our stay at Marian's home was absolutely FANTASTIC. The house is warm, clean, well equiped, lots of lights and in a great location for public transport. Downtown is only 15-20 min. away. The neighbourhood is really nice, lots of great restaurants and parcs to enjoy Boston. We all loved our stay. The communication with Marian was great before and during our stay. She is friendly and had organise a good summary of what is around and how to get here and there. We would definitly want to be back there in a future Boston visit. Thank you Marian!"
非常棒的一次体验!房子设施齐全质量很好!房东很细致认真的为房客着想!
"Hosts made us feel very welcome, with clear instructions on accessing the home and all of its amenities and even providing an assorted welcome basket with snacks and toiletries! Great location! Will stay here again on future visits. "
"We loved this house and it's very convenient location for both buses and T to downtown.The neighbourhood is lively with cafes,bars and eateries to suit all pockets and we found the people very friendly and helpful.
Very well equipped,immaculately clean with recently refurbed kitchen and baths ,secure and cosy.
"
Wonderful house exactly as described. Brilliant location and super mod cons made it a very comfortable stay in a stylish setting. Great spot for us and our boys.  Thank you so much.
"We love our stay at Woody and Pauline's place at JP! :)

I still remember when we entered the house for the first time, we all went ""WOW"". Photos don't do justice to how beautiful the house is. It is very well-maintained, cosy, and elegant. The house is also well stocked with cutlery and utensils if you wish to whip up a meal, else Woody and Pauline has kindly compiled recommendations and take out menus in a small folder. In addition, we found the washing machine and dryer very useful. 

Other than that, the neighbourhood is safe and quiet. The house is near Green Street T, which makes exploring the city easy. Although to be honest, because we were a huge group, taking Uber was a more convenient yet affordable alternative. 

Lastly, would love to thank Woody in particular for being so accommodating and kind. He has been very patient in all our correspondence. We will definitely stay here again if we are in Boston!"
"Celia is an excellent host, very responsive to any queries and easy to communicate with. This worked well for us as we rented the house for a long period during the summer. The house is as described (spacious and charming), well stocked with anything you might need for your stay, and boasts a large deck and gardens. 
It's a quiet neighbourhood with easy access to green spaces (the arboretum is a 5 min walk), and a bus route into central JP, which offers frequent onward connections to downtown Boston. JP is a vibrant, friendly community with no shortage of amenities.
We have recently moved into a place of our own in the vicinity but I would not hesitate to recommend Celia and her house to visiting family and friends."
"We continue to extend our stay at celia's place. It's a great house for a family and the garden is kept in lovely condition to allow my two children to run around and burn off a bit of energy. We still haven't tried all the teas in Celia's cupboard. Being so near the Arboretum is a real treat. Given we've stayed so long there have been some questions and issues and Celia is very flexible, accommodating and friendly. Thanks."
"Celia has continued to make us most welcome - being accommodating to our summer schedule. We have had a couple of questions regarding the car and the lawn and both have been resolved, remotely within the day. This responsiveness is fantastic. On a warm evening the deck is a lovely place to enjoy a drink and dinner."
"Spacious and charming it is. We are staying here for 3 months after moving from the UK. 

The house is not just somewhere to say - it's so obviously a home. There's a wild mix of books and objets d'art; from coding manuals, to serious literature to a book on manhole covers! The main picture shows a similarly eclectic range of board games. We found a similar story in the ""tea"" cupboard in the kitchen. More than enough for the English palette. 

The garden is big and there is a lovely raised deck.

The location could not be better. I am commuting to South Station each day and I can choose to either walk through the magnificent Arboretum to the station or catch a bus that is 5 minutes walk. My wife and kids head into JP central on a bus and that offers something for everyone. 

We are renting the car through RelayRides which is super handy.

Celia has been helpful and friendly throughout. I raised a couple of questions e.g. getting a key stuck in a lock, andCelia resolved it the same day. 

The cats appear at 10pm and have disappeared again by morning. Where do they sleep - that's the question?"
"The house was very cute and comfy. The only thing to be aware of is that the full bathroom can only be accessed by walking through one of two bedrooms. There are window AC units which helped a lot when it was very warm, but overall the home stayed fairly cool. There were plenty of bathroom amenities, which I really appreciated. The decor and vibe of the house is pretty neat. Overall, it was a good place to stay."
"It's a marvelous house during stay in boston, everything is good, hosts prepared all the stuffs for a family short-ime living, the kitchen materials are far more rich, especially with many unexpected findings, the furnitures are comfortable, collected from all different places, the decorations are elaborately designed, the appliances are more than enough to use, the backyard is an adventure with joy, not far from orangeline, it's easy to go downtown for a lot of things, the hosts have deep understandings and love about life and taste, very kind and considerate ,the more we stay, the more we found the quality of the house. "
"We spent 10 lovely days at Derek's beautiful home in JP. 
The photography fails to do this place justice - it's the very definition of a hidden gem. This gorgeous Victorian home is furnished with beautiful items likely gathered from a lifetime of traveling- or so I like to think :) The kitchen is a wannabe chef's dream with a professional grade stove that responds to every twitch or tweak you could hope for. It was a dream come true for my husband to cook on it. The kitchen has everything you would need including little details like ziplock bags, tupperware and all common spices and seasonings. As if that were enough - there was coffee and even a lovely bottle of Malbec to greet us. It was clear that this is a home that makes every effort to be a wonderful host to those who stay there.
The house also has a high chair, laundry, wifi and a lovely back yard with a weber grill and outdoor seating. Each room has a ceiling fan which is very helpful in the heat although the house is nicely protected by the heat anyway. The greatest virtue is the location. This house is ideally, almost obscenely well located. The house is 3 minutes walk from Stonybrook  T station which places you on the Orange line, a direct shot into the heart of Boston in under 15 minutes. And literally on the doorstep are 2 amazing family parks if you are bringing your little ones along for the ride. If you are feeling adventurous there are two further parks no more than 10 minutes away while the Sam Adams Brewery complex has a host of cafes and bars within a 10 minutes walk. If you want to stretch your legs a little further you can stroll to Whole Foods or the Centre Street stretch of Jamaica Plain where there are an abundance of cafes, stores and mischief to be found!.
This is comfortably the best Air BnB we've ever stayed within -  perfect location, a characterful house and a wonderful way to begin your Boston Adventure."
"This house in a quiet neighborhood was perfect for our family's first trip to Boston. It was immaculately clean with plush towels, very comfortable beds, pillows and linens. It was totally up to date with wifi, A/C and stainless steel appliances. Nice, full bath upstairs with a good shower, double sink and tile floor. Half bath on the main floor. Washer and dryer were available for us to use, although we didn't need it. It's an easy, short walk to the Transit station and only a 10 min. ride to downtown Boston. My son played some pick up games of basketball in the nice park right across the street. A very friendly cat lives on the premises. I appreciated the good communication with the host, Liesl, who seemed to really care that our stay at her home and in Boston was enjoyable.  Thanks Leisl."
Steve and Leisl madder us feel very welcome. They even offered food from their cabinets. House was very comfortable and clean. Great place for kids.
"This was a great house for our stay in Boston! The area, Jamaica Plains, is a great location- you can easily walk to several great restaurants & the Sam Adams brewery. The T was only a couple of blocks away & then it was only a 10 min ride to the center of Boston. The house was comfortable & updated. We got to meet the host upon arriving & she was great! The communication was the best I've ever had through the booking & rental process and I've rented a lot of places. There is a cat on property, Earl Gray, who is so friendly & awesome to have around. All in all, a great experience- I highly recommend staying here! "
